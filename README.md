# LSTM-music


With the help of Music21, Keras and LSTM networks here is a way to generate music.

The input and output songs consists of piano music in MIDI format.


The following are the main steps followed in the application:

 * Getting the notes, pitches and number of notes from all of the songs
 * Preparing the input by normalizing the notes
 * Creating the LSTM network
 * Getting the predicted song output
 * Generating the output MIDI song
 * Printing a graphic of the song
 * Comparing the generated song with the input songs to see the similarity percent
